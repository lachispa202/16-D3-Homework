          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Health insurance coverage seems higher in states with a lower percentage of poverty. </p>

          <p>There appears to be a slight trend between higher rates of poverty and higher percentage of people obese
            and or who smoke. However, it does not appear to be a very strong correlation as the distribution of data
            points within the chart fit one distinctive line.</p>

          <p>Regarding age, there appears to be no clear trend between insurance, smoking, and obesity. Geography might
            impact some of correlations meaning states with higher frequency of smoking may have a greater amount of
            obesity. However, there will always be exceptions which includes Texas that has a lower frequency of smoking
            yet has a
            higher obeserved rate of obesity. </p>

          <p>Finally, there is clear trend is observed for household income in which higher the income results in lower
            frequency of lacking healthcare, lower frequancy of smoking, and less obesity. </p>
